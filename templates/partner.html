(collectively, the "Networks"). <br/>We are not a bank and we do not offer banking services as defined by the Nigerian Department of Treasury.<br/>
						ShakaraExpress facilitates the processing of payments Professionals receive from Clients. This means that we collect, analyze and relay information generated in connection with these payments.<br/>
						 
						<h3>Authorization</h3><br/>
						Professionals authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each payment transaction that you authorize. <br/>Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until your Account is closed or terminated.<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<h3>Third Party Payment Service Provider</h3><br/>
						Users will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to the Company and the Payment Service Provider retained by ShakaraExpress (the "PSP"). <br/>As a condition of ShakaraExpress enabling payment processing services through the PSP, you agree to provide ShakaraExpress accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize t ShakaraExpress o share it and transaction information related to your use of the PSP services.<br/>
						Professionals may be required to register with the PSP, agree to a PSP Account Agreement and the Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. By accepting these Terms of Use, each Professional agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. <br/>Please note that the Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that the Company has no obligations or liability to any Professional under the PSP Agreement.<br/>

						<h3>Unauthorized or Illegal Use</h3><br/>
						We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe in our sole discretion that the transaction is in violation of these Terms of Service or any other ShakaraExpress agreement, or that it exposes Professionals, other ShakaraExpress Users, the PSP or ShakaraExpress to harm. <br/>Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts as determined by ShakaraExpress in our sole discretion. <br/>If we reasonably suspect that your Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement.<br/>

						<h3>Accepted Cards</h3><br/>
						ShakaraExpress works with any Nigerian-issued and most non-Nigerian issued credit, debit, prepaid cards ("Cards") with a Visa, or MasterCard logo. We may remove or add Cards that we accept at any time without prior notice. We will generally only process Cards that receive an authorization from the applicable Network and Card issuer. You understand that there may be times when the Client may not be the authorized user of the Card or that such Client may otherwise contest the transaction through the Chargeback process (described below). <br/>You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and to liability associated with such Chargebacks.<br/><br/>

We also may defer payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or governmental entity.<br/>
						 
						<h3>Standard Schedule of Payouts</h3><br/>
						Once you validate your Nigerian bank account, and have five thousand naira or more in your Account, ShakaraExpress will automatically initiate a payout to your bank account at the end of every business day when you have more than five thousand naira in your account. <br/>Payouts to your bank account for payments received before 4pm Pacific Time will usually fund the next business day.<br/>
						For pre-paid ShakaraExpress Booking, we will collect payments from ShakaraExpress Customers on your behalf and successful receipt of payment by us from ShakaraExpress Customers will discharge their debt to you. <br/>If  ShakaraExpress Customers decide to “Pay at Venue”, we will either deduct our Commission from what we owe you or, if we do not hold sufficient funds, the amount payable by you to us will be set out in your Invoice Statement. We will send you an Invoice Statement to be paid within three days of the transaction, the invoice statement will set out what we owe you for Fulfilled Bookings, what you owe us (e.g. Commission, Processing Fees, your Monthly Subscription Fee, any Sign-Up Fee etc.) and the resulting balance (whether you owe us, we owe you or the balance is settled).<br/>
						 
						If we owe you, we will pay this to your bank account within 1-3Business Days of the date of the Invoice Statement.<br/>
						If you owe us, you will pay this to our bank account within 1-3 Business Days of the date of the Invoice Statement.<br/>
						If the balance is settled, we will explain on the Invoice Statement that there is nothing further needed.
						You also grant us ongoing permission under these Partner Terms of Business to deduct any outstanding balance by way of direct debit from your bank account, details of which you have provided to us.<br/><br/>

						<h2>Customer Care</h2><br/>
						Each Professional, as a separate entity from ShakaraExpress is solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to such Professional's goods or services, including without limitation, any Services, pricing, order fulfillment, order or appointment cancellation, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, and feedback concerning experiences with such Professional, any personnel, their policies or processes. <br/>In performing customer service, Professionals must present themselves as a separate entity from ShakaraExpress. <br/>As between Professionals and ShakaraExpress, ShakaraExpress is solely responsible for customer service issues relating to any Account, payment, Card processing, debiting or crediting.<br/><br/>
						 
						<h2>Refunds and Returns</h2><br/><br/>
						By accepting payment Card transactions with ShakaraExpress, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Account in accordance with these Terms of Service and Network Rules. <br/>Network Rules require that you will <br/>(a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; <br/>(b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to Clients at the time of purchase, <br/>(c) not give cash refunds to a Client in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and <br/>(d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Client for postage that the Client paid to return merchandise. <br/>If you accept returns and are making an uneven exchange of merchandise (e.g., the sales price is not the same), you must issue a credit for the total amount of the merchandise being returned and complete a new sale for any new merchandise. Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the Client, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.<br/>
						You can process a refund through your Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment. If your available ShakaraExpress balance is insufficient to cover the refund, ShakaraExpress will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account. ShakaraExpress will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account, and credit it back into your Client's Card. <br/>The Fees are also refunded by ShakaraExpress, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your Client. <br/>ShakaraExpress has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.<br/><br/>

						<h2>Liability for Chargebacks and Fraudulent Actions</h2><br/><br/>

Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these Terms of Service until such time that: <br/>(a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Client's complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; <br/>(b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Client may dispute that the transaction has expired; or <br/>(c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. <br/>You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys' fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all Account deficit balances unpaid by you.<br/><br/>

If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your Account. <br/>If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these Terms of Service.

If you owe us an amount that exceeds your balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Account or any connected Account (as well as set off against any balance in any connected Account). <br/>Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these Terms of Service.

ShakaraExpress will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. <br/>Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.<br/><br/>

Please note that Customers are entitled to cancel eVoucher Bookings at any time up until expiry or redeem eVouchers for a different Partner Service and/or with a different Partner and the Partner will have no rights to that eVoucher Booking until it has been redeemed on the platform and therefore become a Fulfilled Booking.<br/><br/>
						ShakaraExpress will offer a refund in respect of ShakaraExpress Bookings which are cancelled (or unable to be rescheduled) provided the relevant appointment is not due to take place in either the next 72 hours, 48 hours or 24 hours, or any such timeframe to be selected by the Partner.<br/><br/>
						If a Customer wishes to change the date and/or time of a ShakaraExpress Booking, provided the Customer contacts us to do so at least 24 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours prior to the time of the appointment (or any such time as selected by the Partner at the time of subscribing to the ShakaraExpress Services), the Partner must endeavor to offer the Customer a suitable alternative booking time and/or date. In the event that a Partner is unable or unwilling to fulfill a ShakaraExpress Booking pursuant to a Customer requesting such a change, ShakaraExpress will treat the Booking as cancelled by the Customer and will refund the Customer the full amount.<br/>
						If a Partner wishes to change the date and/or time of a ShakaraExpress Booking, in the event that the Customer is unable or unwilling to agree to such change, ShakaraExpress will treat the Booking as cancelled by the Partner and will refund the Customer the full amount. However, if ShakaraExpress deems it reasonable to do so in the circumstances, and at ShakaraExpress’s sole discretion, ShakaraExpress may still require the Partner to pay the applicable amount of Commission that would have been due from the Partner in respect of that Booking.<br/>
						The Partner is responsible for ensuring that all Partner Content (especially details of and prices for the Partner Services) that it publishes or provides to ShakaraExpress to publish on the Page(s) is accurate, correct and not misleading. The Partner should only upload photographs to its Page(s) which have been taken at the Partner’s own venue and should always ensure that it has the right to use any such photographs uploaded. Any breach of this is a Material Breach of this Agreement. If the Partner does not have any photographs available to upload, ShakaraExpress is happy to upload some suitable photographs from its own database so please just let us know.<br/>
						The Partner acknowledges and agrees that its Page(s) on the Website and App should not contain any contact details, direct references or links to the Partner or its website, app, platform, tool or other devices or to websites, apps, platforms, tools or other devices of third parties.<br/>
						The Partner must at all times supply the Partner Services on the Website and App at a price which is accurate and conforms with the best available rate offered on the Partner's own website. If a Customer provides proof of a better price available on the Partner's own website for Partner Services booked through the Website or App, ShakaraExpress reserves the right to refund the Customer the difference and to adjust the amount paid to the Partner in connection with those Partner Services accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partner is permitted to offer lower prices or special offers to closed groups of individuals, both online and offline, e.g. to members of its own loyalty scheme, or directly in the Partner’s venue, and also on other alternative online sales platforms. A breach of this clause shall be a Material Breach of this Agreement.<br/><br/>
						The Partner must ensure that it has obtained the consent of each of its employees and contractors to be advertised on the Website and App to Customers including but not limited to details such as name, expertise, contact details, availability and services offered.<br/><br/>
						The Partner is solely responsible for ensuring that the information on the platform regarding time and date availability is kept completely up to date so that potential Customers are able to view the accurate time and date availability at the time of making a Booking.<br/><br/>
						In respect of ShakaraExpress Bookings made using the “Pay at Venue” option, the Commission shall be payable for all such ShakaraExpress Bookings except where a “no show” has been flagged by the Partner on the platform by midnight on the date of the appointment. For the avoidance of doubt, if a “no show” has not been flagged on the platform by midnight on the date of the appointment, the Booking will be treated by ShakaraExpress as fulfilled and s ShakaraExpress hall be entitled to receive Commission in respect of that ShakaraExpress Booking.<br/>
						The Partner shall not solicit Customers to make Bookings otherwise than through the Website, (as applicable).<br/>
						Where a Customer makes a Booking and the Partner encourages that Customer to cancel their Booking and make a separate booking directly with the Partner, the Partner shall be in Material Breach of this Agreement.<br/>
						If ShakaraExpress has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Partner has made or makes any direct or indirect attempt to avoid paying any Charges, for example without limitation, by fraudulently flagging a Fulfilled Booking using the “Pay at Venue” option as a “no show”, this shall be a Material Breach of this Agreement and shall give ShakaraExpress the right, without limiting other remedies available to it, to withhold and retain any payments due to the Partner under this Agreement.<br/><br/>

						<h2>CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COMPLAINTS</h2><br/><br/>
						The Partner shall use best endeavors to provide top quality Partner Services to all Customers and shall promptly deal with any sales enquiries, matters or issues relating to Bookings or potential Bookings including dealing with Customer complaints.<br/><br/>
						The Partner shall be directly responsible to the Customer for any failure to fulfill the Customer’s expectations or for any other legal liability which arises in respect of the Partner Services, save where such liability arises as a result of ShakaraExpress’s negligence.<br/>
						ShakaraExpress shall refer any Customer complaints it receives to the Partner and the Partner shall acknowledge all complaints, and shall respond to the relevant Customer within 48 hours of the Partner’s receipt of a complaint (whether the complaint has come directly from the Customer or via ShakaraExpress).
						The Partner shall make all efforts to reach a resolution to any complaints within 14 days and must notify ShakaraExpress of any correspondence between the Partner and the Customer relating to the complaint and generally keep ShakaraExpress apprised of its progress and the status of the complaint.<br/>
						The Partner hereby acknowledges and accepts that the Website and App includes a reviewing platform, upon which Customers may post publicly viewable reviews about their experiences with ShakaraExpress and with the Partner (particularly in relation to the Partner Services) (“User Generated Content”) and that a selection of reviews from preceding months will also be made available on the Partner Site (if applicable). The Partner should note that this platform may not be opted out from and may from time to time contain negative reviews and/or feedback from Customers, which is outside ShakaraExpress’s control. <br/>There is an option for the Partner, if they are the subject of any User Generated Content, to reply to reviews about them. However, any content the Partner posts in response to User Generated Content must be polite and professional and non-threatening or confrontational, and it may be subject to review by ShakaraExpress (and may be removed or amended in ShakaraExpress’s sole discretion if ShakaraExpress deems it reasonably necessary to do so). For the avoidance of doubt, the Partner shall have no right to any remedy (including without limitation, any right to terminate this Agreement) as a result of any User Generated Content naming or referring to the Partner. However, if the Partner, acting reasonably, feels that any User Generated Content is defamatory of the Partner or any person or in some other way is a violation of any person’s legal rights, the Partner may flag and report that User Generated Content to ShakaraExpress. In such case, ShakaraExpress shall review the same and in its sole discretion take any action it deems necessary or desirable (including, for example, removing or amending the relevant piece of User Generated Content).<br/>
