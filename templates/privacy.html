				<strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand our Users, we might analyze the personal data that is provided through the Services in aggregate form.

				<strong>Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Files:</strong> In operating this Website and the Services, we may use technologies such as cookies, web beacons and log files. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Website gives to your computer when you access a website.

Google may include in-ads notice labels to disclose interest-based advertising to their users. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the Website. Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy. Google reserves the right to display to users which remarketing lists users are on, along with the corresponding domain name. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preference Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/), and you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin. <br/><br/>
