				<strong> The ShakaraExpress Services </strong>

				ShakaraExpress is a platform that connects salons, fashion stores, health and wellness centres, merchants, stylists and professionals etc. (collectively or individually, "Professionals" “Merchants" “Partners” or “Service Providers" as the case may be) providing hair, beauty, fashion and other health and wellness services and products ("Merchants offerings'') with clients seeking such services and/or products ("Clients" or "you"). The Professionals and Clients are both users of the Services provided by ShakaraExpress and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users." <br/><br/>

				ShakaraExpress solely provides a booking + e-commerce marketplace for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Merchants offerings. The site is a platform through which certain merchants (“Merchants") (a) sell “new" and “repeat" professional beauty, fashion and wellness styling service appointments for specific dates and times (“Merchants bookings") (b) sell vouchers for merchants goods, services or experience (“Vouchers") (c) sell gift cards (“Merchants gift cards") (d) sell deals direct supplied products (“Merchants products") (e) make available coupons, promotional codes, giveaways, samples and offers (“Coupons") (f) make available advertising models (“Adverts") (Collectively (a) – (f), “Merchants offerings").  ShakaraExpress does not provide or contract for Merchants offerings and Professionals and Clients contract independently for the provision of Merchants offerings. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Merchants offerings, purchase and delivery terms, the Merchants offerings to be provided and the location at which the Merchant services will be performed, whether on the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Merchant offerings or by a Professional to provide Merchant offerings is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and Professionals. <br/><br/>

				ShakaraExpress does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Merchants offerings provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. ShakaraExpress makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Merchants offerings provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional and their products or services. You understand that ShakaraExpress does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. ShakaraExpress does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Merchants offerings provided on the Services. ShakaraExpress does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShakaraExpress may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not ShakaraExpress conducts a background check or first party interview on a Professional, each Client must decide whether a Professional is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone they don't know. <br/><br/>

The Professionals are only allowed to do so in accordance with any policy posted on such Professional's ShakaraExpress page at the time of your booking. By entering your payment information when requested, you authorize ShakaraExpress and its payment processors to charge and process the fees and charges assessed in connection with your reservations in accordance with the policy described on the Professional's ShakaraExpress page at the time of your booking. While ShakaraExpress takes what it believes to be reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information to third parties who assess and process payments, ShakaraExpress is not responsible for any fees or charges assessed by third parties or any errors in the processing of payments by third parties, including any errors that result from third-party negligence, improper transmission of payment information, your mistaken submission of payment information, or your submission of erroneous payment information. <br/><br/>

				Although the Services are intended to provide a Professional's availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the Professional to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the Services is not a guarantee that the Professional will honor the reservation as scheduled.

				ShakaraExpress cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User. <br/>

				Informal Negotiations
				To expedite resolution and the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Service ("Dispute"), you and ShakaraExpress agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to ShakaraExpress. ShakaraExpress's address for such notices is ShakaraExpress LTD, Inc., 10B Adenike Wole Ajibode, Lekki Phase 1 Lagos, Nigeria. 100101. Attention: 
				If you and ShakaraExpress are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. <br/><br/>



				<strong>Applicable law and jurisdiction</strong><br/><br/>

				These Terms and Conditions of Use shall be interpreted and governed by the laws in force in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Subject to the Arbitration section below, each party hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Nigeria and to waive any objections based upon venue.
				Arbitration <br/><br/>

				Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions of Use will be referred to and finally settled by private and confidential binding arbitration before a single arbitrator held in Nigeria in English and governed by Nigeria law pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act Cap A18 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, as amended, replaced or re-enacted from time to time.
				The arbitrator shall be a person who is legally trained and who has experience in the information technology field in Nigeria and is independent of either party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Website reserves the right to pursue the protection of intellectual property rights and confidential information through injunctive or other equitable relief through the courts.<br/><br/>

				The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, you and ShakaraExpress may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br/><br/>

				<strong>Severability</strong><br/><br/>

				If any provision(s) of these Terms is held by a court of Competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provisions(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the Parties as reflected in the provisions(s)) and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

				Take Notice that the ShakaraExpress’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to ShakaraExpress in writing.<br/><br/>
